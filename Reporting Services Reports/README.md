# Connected Cow Reporting Services reports

This folder contains the Reporting Services Visual Studio Solution with 2 reports that show how you can leverage the R visualizations in Reporting Services reports.

- CowBreakdown.rdl - Shows an overview of the cows that are in estrus at 0600 hrs, and the number of hours they have been in estrus

- FarmHeatmap.rdl - Shows a heatmap of all the farms, and the estrus status at each of the farm in different hours of the day. When a cell is darker red, there are more cows that are in estrus.
