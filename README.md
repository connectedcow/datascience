Microsoft’s Joseph Sirosh shared a surprising conversation about a farmer’s dilemma, a professor’s ingenuity and how cloud, data and devices came together to fundamentally re-imagine an age old way of doing business.

This repository provides you with a sample database, and reports that shows you how you can use SQL Server 2016 R Services to build a machine learning for detecting estrus in cows.
